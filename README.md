## My process

- I wrote the html first to structure the webpage.
- I created Sass partials and folders to organise the Sass workflow.
- I used the mobile-first approach to create the layout for smaller devices.
- I used Flexbox to build the mobile layout and modified the Flex items to achieve the desired desktop layout.
- I used @mixins, and @media queries to create breakpoints for Mobile and Desktop layouts.

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- CSS Custom Prpoerties
- Sass Built-in modules (sass:map and sass:math)
- Flexbox

#Note: This solution does not use CSS Grid. The naming convention used for classes in this solution starts with ".grid" because I initially started working on this solution using Grid. I later realized using Flexbox was a simpler approach for this solution. Kindly ignore the class naming convention for this solution.
